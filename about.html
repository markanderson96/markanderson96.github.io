            Hello! <br><br>
            I am Mark Anderson and I am a PhD student in the SIGMEDIA Group at Trinity College Dublin. <br>
            I am studying under the supervision of Dr. Naomi Harte and my research is on the automatic and remote monitoring of birds through their vocalisations.<br>
            My background is primarily in signal processing (originally analogue but now mostly digital) and now moving slightly more into the deep learning sphere, <br>
            although I like to stick to signal processing whenever I can (deep learning is a useful tool, but not the be all end all!). <br>
            I got my Bachelors from Trinity in 2018, followed by my masters degree in 2019. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Besides my research, I am interested in music (I play concertina, guitar and do a bit of music production/synth work), retro/vintage computing, <br>
            electronics (also as a hobby), ham radio, photography and video games. So you may see some projects relating to those here, or on github in general. <br>
            Software wise I like to mess around with various deep learning methods for synthesis, or code up useful tools for myself, or sometimes tools that aren't useful but were fun anyway! <br>
            I do hope to add more hardware projects soon, I have some test equipment designs, synthesisers/eurorack modules, blinky things. Fun things like that.
        </p>
